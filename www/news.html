		At Aerosoft we love Greece. There might be in economic dire straits but the beauty of the islands will never diminish, just as the friendliness of the people. So travel with Aerosoft and 29Palms to Mikonos, land on the small airport to refuel and fly around the island to explore the rugged mountains and coastline. See the typical architecture of the villages with the white houses and blue doors. You can almost smell the ouzo. Check out the preview images and warm up your credit cards for a October release. </p><br><br>
